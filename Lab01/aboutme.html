            <p>
                My name is Ricardo and I really enjoy listening to music. My favorite artist(s) of all time is The Strokes. 
                I enjoy all genres but mostly listen to Rock, mainly Title fight, Black midi, and end it (a local band).
                Latley I've been listening to more Jazz and HyperPop music though, a lot of Chet baker, Miles davis, 
                Crystal Castle and Charlie xcx.
