            <p> 
                The website has a Hierarchical Organization. It has a clearly defined
                    home page, on the side it has navigation links to major site sections,
                    and you can get to any of the major sections with one click.

            <h3> Question 7: What is the site's effectiveness? Does it support users in completing actions accurately?</h3>
            <p> 
                The site is 
                    effective in doing what it was intended for which is to help the user find new music it does this through suggesting music
                based on what you have previously listend to, suggest random songs and filtering songs based on genre. I belive it support the 
            user in completing actions accurately.

                The site if very effcient, there is only a couple 
                of major sections and it is easy to navigate. Users are able to perform tasks quickly because you can navigate most of the major sections
                with on click.

            <h3> Question 9: How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?:</h3>
            <p> 
                The engagement is not very good the site has a very bland color scheme and the only images the site contains are the pictures 
                showing the artist picture/logo but I do think that it is appropriate for the topic although a bit lacking.

            <h3> Question 10: Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h3>
            <p> 
                My recommendation for this website would be
                to improve the user interface and make it more visually appealing. The color scheme is just grey and white which makes it bland and 
                and boring to look at.
