            <h2> Lab 1</h2>
             <p> This is my first webpage. It took a while to get familiar but I think I'm doing ok.
                What helped me was the the example code which I feel really made things click for me and helped me understand.
                I learned a lot about how tags work and was introduced to a wide variety of tags. I also got a deeper understandind of HTML, how it work,
                the proper structure and standards to follow. Some things I might have trouble with are attributes it reminds me of attributes in Java.

        <article id="lab3">
            <h4> Lab 3</h4>
             <p> This is My webpage for lab 3. This is my first introudction to CSS and my first time using it. I think I got the basics down
                but I still struggle in remebeing certain syntax. I hope that practicing more will help me remeber better and allow me to become more
                proficient. I learned a lot about how to structure CSS and how CSS actually works in sync with HTML. Something that I might have
                trouble with in the future is adding links even though I know how to I somtimes forget the format.

            <h5> Lab 5</h5>
             <p> When designing a webpage, it is important to follow best practices to ensure accessibility, usability, and responsiveness. 
                A structured layout with clear navigation improves the users experience by making content easy to find and interact with.
                You can make use of page layout properties like flexbox, grid, and float to adjust the layout of your webpage to make it
                not only visualy appealing but also user friendly. You can use one or many media query to adjust different properties based on desired 
                conditions to make your webpage accessible and usuable without compromising the look for all devices. 
                Reflecting on this lab I can say that it was not to hard but it was complex.
