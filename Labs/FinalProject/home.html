        <h2> Lesson Learned Reflection</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> Self reflection completing the Final Project</h3>
            <p> While Completing this project I was able to bring everything that I have
                learned thought the course and bring it together. At first there was a lot of worries
            and doubts in my mind on whether or not I would be able to complete the final project.
        I started by making a plan on how I should tackle this project, because this project
        is supposed to showcase our previoous labs I decided to use group together labs 1 through 5 together because they build
        on each other. I then added labs 6,7, and 9 but left out 8 because it just builds on lab 4. I had trouble with the CSS page
        since there is only one CSS page for the whole website and each lab had it's own CSS page, I had to create a very simple CSS page
    for the whole thing so it looks uniform.  </p>

            <h3> Observations</h3>
            <p> An observation or lessons learned by testing on multiple browsers and devices that I learned is that less is more.
                throught this project I was constantly reminded that keeping is simple is best. Adding more whether it be adding more 
            styling or information it's best to keep it simple without compromising visual appeal. If there is to much going on 
        your more likley to confuse youself and just cause a big mess. It's best to keep your website simple and if you want to add more
        you can always add after you have your foundation down. While testing I verified that it was compatible with safari, 
      chrome, firefox and that it was compatible with both my laptop and iphone. This whole process reinforced the importance
    of simplicity because more complex features behaved diffrently in other browsers but a simple layout ensured that my page would look
    how it is intened on every browser across any device.    </p>

            <h2> Lessons learned throughout the course</h2>
            <p> Throughout the course I have learned a lot. I learned a lot about HTML on all its different tags and structure in order to make 
                the foundation for my webpage. I learned how to properly structure and link CSS to an HTML page, along with how to add CSS to HTMl
                directly. I learned about the importance of CSS and how without it webpages would just be boring pages with text only. I learned about
                how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to make an engaing, infornmative and interactive webpage.
                This course not only taught me about coding but also emphasized the importance of organization to me. Due to juggling both HTML and CSS 
                organization had been one of the best tools for being able to complete assignments effectively and on time. Although I am still not
                the best organized this course has placed me in the right direction.
