        <h2>Employment</h2>

        <p> The gif is an animation of a car driving on the road.  I choose this image because as of now I work at my family owned body shop. My role is mainly prep work and detail work.
            I started learning how to my job when I was around 11, I started off learning how to wet sand car parts and eventually learned how to cut and polish. Eventually when i entered highschool
            my dad had saved enough money and decided to open his own body shop and thats how I started working with my family. 
            I enjoy my job most of the time, although im not very interested in cars I do enjoy working with my family.
