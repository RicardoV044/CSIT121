        <h2> My favorite Artist</h2>

        <p> The image is a picture of the band 'The Strokes". My favorite artist/group of all time is The Strokes. The Strokes rose to popularity in the early 2000s with their debut album "Is this it" 
            getting a lot of praise. Their debut album is my favorite album but their best album is The New Abnormal. They influenced other groups like
            The killers, Interpol, Arctic Monkeys and more. I started listening to them in the 8th grade and I just never stopped. I would recommend giving them a listen.</p>
