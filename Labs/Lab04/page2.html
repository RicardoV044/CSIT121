        <h2>Fictional inspirations</h2>

        <p> The image is a picture of Ghost Rider from the movie. One of my biggest inspirations is Ghost Rider from marvel comics. I really like the design of the character and their personality.
            I draw a lot of my style sense from fictional characters and Ghost Rider is definitly one of them, I like their biker look that goes well with the fire 
            coming from thier head. I like how the character carries themselves and how they turn their curse into soemthing positive by helping people.
            I really enjoy reading comics and Ghost Rider is one of my favorite charcters.
