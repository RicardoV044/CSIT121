        <h2> Reflection</h2>
        <p> This module was a bit hard mostly because there was a lot of reading.
            The resources I used during this module were all the Articles and videos
            listed on brightspace. What really helped me during this module were the 
            notes I took while reading which helped me make the basic structure of table 
            with just minor changes of my notes. During this module I learned a lot about
            Tables and how they should be structured and how to make them more accessible.
            I also learned a lot about forms and the proper way to use them as well as when 
            to use ceratin ones.
