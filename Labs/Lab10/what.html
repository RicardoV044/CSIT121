        <h2> Q: What is the Geolocation API</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> A:</h3>
            <p> The Geolocation API is an application programming interface that that provides access to
                geographical location information associated with the hosting device. It gathers your location data 
                by using many sources like GPS signals, IP address, RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth, cell ID and user input.
                There is no guarantee that the API will resturn the devices actual location because the API itself is 
                agnostic of the location information sources (W3C, 2025). An end user usually has to grant permission for
                the API to return the users location. <br> <br>
                If the user grants permission to the Geolocation API it will provide location data. The location data would
                be diaplyed using latitude, longitude, altitude, speed and heading. The Geolocation API also supports 'one shot'
                position updates which allows the user to recive updates for when there is a significant change in location. It allowes
                application to request a cached position. It also allows for the application to get updates errors that have occurred
                during acquiring a position. <br><br>
                The API allows requests for 'high position' data that the user can ignore. WebExtensions that use or want to use Geolocation
                have to add the Geolocation permission to their manifest. The API is accessed through navigator.geolocation. After it is accessed 
                the broweser will ask for the users permission to be able to access the users data. After the user grants the browser permission 
                it will then use the best functionality on the device to get the location data (MDN Web Docs, n.d).
