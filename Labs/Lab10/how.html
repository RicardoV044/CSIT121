        <h2> Q: How is the Geolocation API used</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> A: </h3>
            <p> The Geoloation API is used to determine the users location and using that information
                it provide services. To request specific geographical coordinates websites and apps call methods
                like getCurrentPosition(). The browser then returns information like longitude, latitude, speed and direction.
                The information that the browser resturns allows for features like maps and locators for a variety of services. <br><br>
                One of the most common uses for the Geolocation API is ride sharing services like Uber and lyft. These services
                need real time updates on user and driver location. Withouth geolocation users would not know when their driver 
                would show up because they would not be able to track them. The driver would also not be able to know if the user 
                has moved locations or where they even are. <br><br>
                Some other common uses of the Geolocation API is for emergency services. The Geolocation API could provide
                emergency services like the police or the ambulance information to locate where you are. It is also commonly used by 
                businesses to be able to find their target audeinece like people that may live nearby or for more exposure. It is also used by 
                delievery services whether it be doordash or UPS it can be used to track your package.</p>
