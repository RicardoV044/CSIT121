        <h2> Q: Why is the Geolocation API important</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> A:</h3>
            <p> The geolocation is important because it allows websites and applications to tailor user experience
                based on location. It supports services that rely on real time 
                tracking. Without geolocation many apps and websites would lose all functionality like 
                delivery or weather forcast services. Although it may seem like geolocation may not matter
                it is very important for providing a more satisfying user experience. <br><br>
                The Geolocation API is important because is emphasizes privacy. In a world where technology is growing
                more everyday and being a bigger part of our everyday lives the importance of privacy grows as well. 
                Location data may reveal things that the user may not want to share. The Geolocation API allows users to get
                location information in a safe and secure contexts. <br><br>
                The importance of The Geolocation API lies in its security.
                To enable third party usage you have to set a permission policy response header. The user has to give the 
                browser or application permission to collect location data. This is important because the user can choose not 
                to allow the browser to collect location data if the user does not want to disclose it.    </p>
