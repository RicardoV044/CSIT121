            <p> This is my first webpage. It took a while to get familiar but I think I'm doing ok.
                What helped me was the the example code which I feel really made things click for me and helped me understand.
                I learned a lot about how tags work and was introduced to a wide variety of tags. I also got a deeper understandind of HTML, how it work,
                the proper structure and standards to follow. Some things I might have trouble with are attributes it reminds me of attributes in Java.
            </p>
